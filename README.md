A respository for testing some shareable, reproducible scientific software tools and services.

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/timghill/shareable-science/main?labpath=notebooks)

This repo shows several good (not necessarily best) practices:

 * Working on the `dev` branch to maintain a clean `main` branch and merging with Pull Requests or `git merge` on the command line
 * Writing functional code in the `src/` directory and importing this into analysis `notebooks/` *Not implemented yet. Need the module to be installable by `mybinder`*
 * Online execution using [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)
