[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/timghill/shareable-science/main?labpath=notebooks)

This repo shows several good (not necessarily best) practices:

 [] Working on the `dev` branch to maintain a clean `main` branch
 [] Writing functional code in the `src/` directory and importing this into analysis `notebooks/` *Not functional yet*
 [] Online execution using [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)
