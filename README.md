# shareable-science
A respository for testing some shareable, reproducible scientific software tools and services.

This repo shows several good (maybe not best) practices:

 * Working on the `dev` branch to maintain a clean `main` branch
 * Writing functional code in the `src/` directory and importing this into analysis `notebooks/`
 * Online execution using [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)
